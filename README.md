# MChain

**MChain** is a next-generation, experimental blockchain protocol designed exclusively for Apple Silicon devices â€” specifically the M-series chips (M1, M2, M3, and M4). Leveraging the unique architecture of Apple Silicon, MChain aims to create a decentralized network that rewards efficient, consumer-grade CPUs while discouraging ASIC, GPU, and traditional x86 CPU mining dominance.
