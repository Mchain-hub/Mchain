# MChain Whitepaper

## Abstract

**MChain** is a decentralized, Apple Silicon-optimized blockchain protocol designed to bring mining back to energy-efficient, consumer-grade hardware. MChain leverages a custom Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm optimized for the M-series chip family (M1â€“M4) to create a fairer, more accessible mining landscape. Unlike traditional PoW chains that are dominated by ASICs and GPU farms, MChain enforces architecture-aware mining designed to reward CPU-based contributorsâ€”specifically those using Apple Silicon. MChain aspires to evolve into a robust ecosystem with smart contracts, Proof-of-Inference modules, and an efficient, community-driven governance system.

## Introduction

Bitcoin revolutionized digital value. Ethereum introduced decentralized computing. MChainâ€™s mission is to pioneer hardware-aware decentralization by harnessing the consumer-friendly, high-efficiency computing power of Apple Silicon.

Modern ASICs and high-end GPUs have centralized mining operations in the hands of a few. MChain flips this paradigm by rewarding M-series chip users â€” reclaiming PoW accessibility for independent contributors, hobbyists, and small developers using standard macOS machines.

---

## Motivation

The rise of ASIC-optimized coins and high electricity consumption has rendered CPU mining obsolete for most blockchains. However, with Appleâ€™s M-series chips offering high-performance ARM64 CPUs with integrated Neural Engines, there's an opportunity to:
- Redistribute mining away from industrial farms
- Encourage green and low-energy mining
- Promote technical innovation with purpose-built PoW
- Explore new consensus methods such as Proof-of-Inference

MChain aims to build a blockchain whose consensus directly benefits from and aligns with everyday consumer hardware advances.

---

## Consensus Mechanism

### Proof-of-Work (PoW) Algorithm
MChain uses a custom variant of **RandomX**, modified specifically for:
- NEON SIMD acceleration (used in all M1â€“M4 chips)
- Unified memory architecture of Apple Silicon
- Optional inference tasks targeting the Neural Engine (future)

The algorithm is CPU-bound and memory-hard to discourage ASICs and general-purpose GPUs. Difficulty adjusts dynamically based on network hashrate.

### M-Series Validation
Mining clients validate chip architecture using:
- On-chip instruction benchmarks
- CPU feature detection (e.g. NEON, cache size)
- Runtime performance profiling

Difficulty scaling ensures higher-tier chips (e.g. M4) produce blocks faster but do not monopolize the chain.

## Tokenomics

| Parameter               | Value                  |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| Token Name             | MChain Token (MCT)     |
| Max Supply             | 42,000,000 MCT         |
| Block Time             | 75 seconds             |
| Initial Block Reward   | 15 MCT                 |
| Halving Interval       | Every 4 years          |
| Pre-mine               | 2,000,000 MCT (4.76%)  |
| Mining Allocation      | 40,000,000 MCT (95.24%)|

### Development Fund
The 2,000,000 MCT pre-mine is allocated to:
- Developer grants
- Exchange listing fees
- Infrastructure and wallet support
- Community bounties and marketing

Funds will be held in a transparent public wallet and may be subject to a time-lock or vesting schedule.

## Smart Contracts Roadmap

MChain will introduce a smart contract layer in a future upgrade to enable:
- Decentralized finance (DeFi)
- NFTs and digital asset management
- On-chain governance
- Apple-integrated dApps (e.g. CoreML-powered contracts)

Implementation options:
- Lightweight WASM virtual machine
- ErgoScript-like custom scripting layer
- Optional integration with Risc0 or zkVM for secure computation

---

## Technical Stack

- **Core Protocol**: Fork of Monero (CPU-optimized base)
- **Programming Language**: Rust / C++ (nodes), Swift/Rust (CLI miner)
- **Mining Engine**: Custom RandomX fork
- **Wallet**: macOS-native + cross-platform CLI planned
- **Smart Contracts (future)**: WASM-based runtime or modular script engine

---

## Roadmap Overview

### Phase 1 â€“ Foundation
- Project scope and branding
- GitHub repo creation
- Tokenomics + architecture definition

### Phase 2 â€“ Core Development
- M-series miner with custom RandomX
- Wallet CLI & node setup
- Genesis block + local testnet

### Phase 3 â€“ Network Expansion
- Public testnet
- Block explorer and macOS GUI wallet
- Chip benchmarking system
- Dev grant system initiation

### Phase 4 â€“ Smart Contract Layer
- WASM prototype
- dApp builder tools
- DAO + governance modules

---

## Conclusion

MChain represents a new frontier in blockchain consensus: one that favors personal, energy-efficient computing and values real-world device capability over raw industrial power. By aligning mining with the computing hardware people already own, MChain brings decentralization back to its roots.
